            <h2>The Great Pyramid of Giza</h2>
            <p>The Great Pyramid of giza was built in 2570BC and is still standing. It was built as a tomb for the Egyptian pharaoh Khufu and was a part of a complex that included temples
                and pyramids. Initially standing at 146.6 metres it was the world's tallest human-made structure for more than 3,800 years, but over time the pyramid's height was reduced
                to the current 138.5 metres.</p>

            <h2>Why exactly seven Wonders?</h2>
            <p>
                You might think with such a large of amazing monuments why not all of them become Wonders of the World. The reason of why there are only seven wonders in because
                the ancient Greeks believed in the number seven as a number that represented parfection, thats why Herodotus wrote only about seven architectural achievements.
